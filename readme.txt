== Description ==

Adds shortcode to show content based on Buddypress profile field 

Suppose we have "Gender" profile field for  "Male" and "Female" profle field values .
Here’s how we can use the shortcode :

[profile_field_content profile_field="Gender" profile_field_value="Male"] This content  is for male [/profile_field_content]
[profile_field_content profile_field="Gender" profile_field_value="Female"] This content is for female [/profile_field_content]

Note that the shortcode has two parameter :
profile_field  where you put the profile field
profile_field_value where you put the profile field value .
